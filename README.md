This repository contains documents about Robin Munro. The main documents are the text of a memorial book entitled "THIS WAS A MAN: Robin Munro, 1952-2021". The filenames are "Memorial Book (pdf).pdf" and "Memorial Book (Word).docx". As the filenames suggest, the first file is in PDF format (and includes a book cover), whereas the second file is in Word format.

The book contains the following: obituaries, tributes, Twitter tributes, and a bibliography (usually with links to full text) of Robin's works.

This repository also contains the text of an obituary as it appears in the Journal of Comparative Law. The text is identical to the SOAS obituary that appears in the book.

You may ignore all the other documents; they are now contained in the text of the memorial book. I will delete them from the repository once I figure out how to delete files.

You may purchase a physical copy of the book direct from the printer, Blurb. One version includes a small and unobtrusive Blurb logo on the back of the last page; the other version has no logo but is more expensive. To purchase a copy, go to one of the following links:
